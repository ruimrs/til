## NOTES:

label tag has a bit of special value inside a form. <label> tag inside a form is directly linked with its associated input tag. In simple words, whenever you click on a label, it activates/focuses on its associated input tag.
This can only be done by using the for attribute inside your <label> tag and id inside your <input> tag.
Another thing you can do to do this; just nest the <input> tag inside the <label> tag.
div is just a normal (general) HTML tag. You can use it anywhere you want. Even where you donâ€™t know what to use.
