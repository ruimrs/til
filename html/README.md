# NOTES:

## label vs div:

- label tag has a bit of special value inside a form. label tag inside a form is directly linked with its associated input tag. In simple words, whenever you click on a label, it activates/focuses on its associated input tag. 
- div is just a normal (general) HTML tag. You can use it anywhere you want. Even where you donâ€™t know what to use.
